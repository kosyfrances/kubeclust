Hi Kosy. How are you?
I found you from Codementor.
I have one suggestion. I want to work as a mentor on codementor again.
And I think we can negotiate about it well.
If you don't use your codementor account,
My Skype: sterlingwhite55
My whatsapp: +8618840582219
Please add me on your Skype or Whatsapp so that we can discuss more.
If you don't use the codementor, I'd like to borrow.
Because my account was disabled.
I tried many times to create new one. but every time it was failed
So I decided it would be better to use what existed than to create something new.
I will pay you monthly. I think we can negotiate the price well.
